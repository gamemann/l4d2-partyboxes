A [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) plugin for [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) that turns upgrade boxes such as incendiary and explosive ammo boxes into random/fun boxes. There are three categories a box may be registered under which include **Good**, **Mid**, and **Bad**. Good boxes help the survivors, mid boxes are somewhere in-between (misc?), and bad boxes negatively impact the survivors.

You can configure the chance probability for each box category using SourceMod ConVars which is detailed below.

My main goal is to create a modular core plugin that handles things like picking the box and calculating stats, and then allow developers to create their own boxes as separate SourceMod plugins which register with the core via [natives](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Natives_(SourceMod_Development)) and global [forwards](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Function_Calling_API_(SourceMod_Scripting)).

**NOTE** - This project is a big **work-in-progress** and I'm also pretty rusty in SourcePawn since I haven't utilized it much in recent years so I'm sure there are many things that can be improved on (feel free to make a PR!).

## My Motives
I've been occassionally playing a custom mega (24 players) COOP game server in Left 4 Dead 2 for almost a year now ([Core-SS](https://core-ss.org/forum/)) and I've had a lot of fun! The server runs a custom plugin very similar to this plugin and since I've been wanting to get back into [SourcePawn](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Introduction_to_SourcePawn_1.7), I figured I'd create my own open source plugin (to my knowledge, the plugin they use isn't open source, but even if it was, I really wanted to make my own to get back into SourcePawn again).

Additionally, I've been really wanting to get back into learning game development so I can create open source 3D games in the future and I really believe creating plugins like this and modding in general can really help with understanding game development further!

## Core
### Config & ConVars
A config file should be generated to `cfg/sourcemod/plugin.l4d2pb.cfg`. Additionally, box-specific configs should be located in the same directory.

Here's the output of the `plugin.l4d2pb.cfg` config file for more information on the current core ConVars.

</details>

### Commands
Here are a list of commands you may run from chat (prefixed with `!` or `/`) or console (prefixed with `sm_`).

| Command | Admin Only | Arguments | Description |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- |
| l4d2pb_stats | No | - | Displays stats in chat. |
| l4d2pb_open | Yes | (1) Box Name | Manually *opens* a box determined by box name argument. Requires root admin flag. |

### Enums
Here are some useful enums you'll need when developing your own box types.

```c
enum BoxType {
    BOXTYPE_NONE = 0,
    BOXTYPE_GOOD = 1,
    BOXTYPE_MID = 2,
    BOXTYPE_BAD = 3
}
```

### Natives
Here are a list of core natives you may use when developing your own box types. Take a look at [`scripting/l4d2pb-box-test.sp`](./scripting/l4d2pb-box-test.sp) for a basic example.

```c
/**
 * Registers a box to core and adds it to the box rotation.
 *
 * @param type      The box type (BoxType enum).
 * @param name      A short/code name for the box.
 * @param display   The box display name.      
 *
 * @return 0 on success or 1 on error.
 */
native int L4D2PB_RegisterBox(BoxType type, const char[] name, const char[] display);

/**
 * Unloads a box from the core.
 *
 * @param name      A short/code name for the box.
 *
 * @return 0 on success or 1 on error.
 */
native int L4D2PB_UnloadBox(const char[] name);

/**
 * Prints a debug message from the core plugin.
 *
 * @param req      The required verbose level from the core plugin.
 * @param msg      The debug message to send.
 * @param ...      Formatted arguments for msg.
 *
 * @return void
 */
native void L4D2PB_DebugMsg(int req, const char[] msg, any...);

/**
 * Prints a message to a client's chat from the core plugin (recommended).
 *
 * @param client   The client's index to print to.
 * @param msg      The message to print.
 * @param ...      Formatted arguments for msg.
 *
 * @return void
 */
native void L4D2PB_PrintToChat(int client, const char[] msg, any...);

/**
 * Prints a message to all clients from the core plugin (recommended).
 *
 * @param msg      The message to print.
 * @param ...      Formatted arguments for msg.
 *
 * @return void
 */
native void L4D2PB_PrintToChatAll(const char[] msg, any...);
```

### Forwards
Here are core (global) forwards you may call while developing your own box types. Take a look at [`scripting/l4d2pb-box-test.sp`](./scripting/l4d2pb-box-test.sp) for a basic example.

```c
/**
 * Called when the core plugin is initially loaded (in OnPluginStart()).
 * 
 */
public void L4D2PB_OnCoreLoaded();

/**
 * Called when the core plugin executes its config (in OnConfigsExecuted()).
 * 
 * @note This is where I recommend registering a box.
 * 
 */
public void L4D2PB_OnCoreCfgsLoaded();

/**
 * Called when the core plugin is unloaded (in OnPluginEnd()).
 * 
 */
public void L4D2PB_OnCoreUnloaded();

/**
 * Called when a box is opened.
 * 
 * @param type      The type of box opened.
 * @param boxName   The box short/code name that was opened.
 * @param userid    The user ID who opened the box.
 * 
 */
public void L4D2PB_BoxOpened(int type, const char[] boxName, int userId);
```

## Provided Boxes
Here are a list of boxes provided in this repository. Boxes are developed as separate plugins that use forwards and natives from the core plugin to register the box and such.

### [Damage](./scripting/l4d2pb-box-dmg.sp)
This is a damage box registered under the **Bad** category. It is enabled by default and damages the user and potentially players around them depending on the ConVar values set when opened.

### More Boxes In Development!
I plan to keep adding boxes over time! If you would like to make your own boxes and release them here, feel free to make a pull request!

## Building
Firstly, you'll want to download SourceMod from [here](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php).

Afterwards, extract the compressed file(s) and keep note of the path to the `addons/sourcemod/scripting` directory.

On Linux, you may use the [`build.sh`](./build.sh) Bash script included in this repository to build all plugins in [`scripting/`](./scripting/). You'll want to set the `SM_DIR` environmental variable to the path to the `addons/sourcemod/scripting` directory mentioned above (by default, it's set to `/opt/sourcemod/addons/sourcemod/scripting`). 

Additionally, you may set the `SRC_DIR` environment variable which is the path to the plugin's source code (`$(pwd)/scripting` by default) and `BUILD_DIR` which is the directory used to store the compiled plugins (`$(pwd)/build` by default).

On Windows, there isn't a Batch script created at the moment (to do...), but simply dragging the plugin's source code files inside of the `addons/sourcemod/scripting/compile.exe` should be fine. Just make sure to copy [`scripting/include/l4d2pb-core.inc`](./scripting/include/l4d2pb-core.inc) into `addons/sourcemod/scripting/include`.

**NOTE** - I've included a [`tasks.json`](./vscode/tasks.json) file for Visual Studio Code that builds the current file you're working on with a task! You can bind the task execution to a keyboard shortcut to make building very easy inside of VS Code.

### Using [Multi Colors](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=247770)
If you want to utilize Multi Colors inside of chat messages and such, you will need to uncomment the `#define USE_COLORS` line in the [`scripting/l4d2pb-core.sp`](./scripting/l4d2pb-core.sp#7) file and recompile.

Afterwards, you should be able to utilize colors such as `{red}` inside of translations files located in [`translations/`](./translations/) directory.

## Installing
After building the plugin's source code, copy the compiled plugin files (ending in `.smx`) to the game server's `addons/sourcemod/plugins/` directory.

Also, copy all translation files from [`translations/`](./translations/) to the game server's `addons/sourcemod/translations/` directory.

Afterwards, you may restart the server/map or load the plugins manually via `sm plugins load <plugin name>` (e.g. `sm plugins load l4d2pb-core`) to load the plugins.
