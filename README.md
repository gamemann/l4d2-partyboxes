## Not Finished & Work In Progress!!!

A [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) plugin for [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) that turns upgrade boxes such as incendiary and explosive ammo boxes into random/fun boxes.

This is something I'm going to work on as time goes on and don't have any release date. My main goal is to create a modular core that allows the development of separate plugins as "Boxes" that are chosen from randomly.

I've been really wanting to get back into learning game development so I can create open source games in the future, but first I wanted to make a mod/plugin to Left 4 Dead 2 game servers running SourceMod.

## Preview
*To Do...*

## Config & ConVars
A config file should be generated to `cfg/sourcemod/plugin.l4d2pb.cfg`. Additionally, box-specific configs should be located in the same directory.

Here's the output of the `plugin.l4d2pb.cfg` config file for more information on the current core ConVars.

```bash
