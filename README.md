## Not Finished & In Progress!!!**

A [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) plugin for [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) that turns upgrade boxes such as incendiary and explosive ammo boxes into random/fun boxes.

This is something I'm going to work on as time goes on and don't have any release date. My main goal is to create a modular core that allows the development of separate plugins as "Boxes" that are chosen from randomly.

I've been really wanting to get back into learning game development so I can create open source games in the future, but first I wanted to make a mod/plugin to Left 4 Dead 2 game servers running SourceMod.
